How much of your life have you shared? [Find out here.](https://tommilligan.github.io/percent-anniversary/)

## Brief

Calculate and display data about life events.

## Tech

`index.html` can be served as is. Dependencies are pulled in from:

* [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Libraries used:

* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) - great minimalist HTML/CSS boilerplate
* [D3](https://d3js.org/) - data visualisation
* [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) - time management

## Learning

Learning motivations here were to get back to basics:

* Construct element using the low level D3 API
* Work in vanilla JS/CSS - no JQuery!

It was good to get down to brass tacks in some cases, especially things like:

* Scales and coordinate manipuation
* DOM element modification
* Window/element events
